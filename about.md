  Self motivated Developer, used to work in Web Development but since I've had lots of time since over lockdown mostly focused on low level C/Rust development, and whatever python projects caught my attention. Most recently have participated in [Govhack 2021](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/projects/matchy_matchy) and [Hackvision 2021](https://devpost.com/software/greensnap-j81rc3), but otherwise focusing on my degree at RMIT university.
